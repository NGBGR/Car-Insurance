Data Challenge (1 of 2): Data Engineering 

Dataset: Twitter data of ~42M users (5.9GB zip file, which is 23GB after unzip)

•	Download Link: http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/twitter
•	TSV File: twitter.tar.bz2

What you need to do:

•	Short summary of dataset’s characteristics 
•	Perform an exploratory analysis on the dataset
o	It’s an open-end question.
o	Are there any insights you could find?
•	Use Python and Jupyter notebook
•	You can use any Python libraries as you see fit.
•	Write your comments along with the codes
What we are looking for: 
•	There’s no right or wrong answer, we’re interested in how you think and go around solving the problem.
•	We’re curious to see what combination of libraries you’ll be using and what insights you’ll find.
•	Your code should be scalable. It should NOT break if we’re going to run your code on a low-end machine, e.g. 4GB RAM. 

Data Challenge (2 of 2): Data Science

Dataset: 

•	‘BGL Data.csv’
•	‘Data Dictionary.xlsx’

What you need to do:

•	Short summary of dataset’s characteristics 
•	Perform an exploratory analysis on the dataset
o	It’s an open-end question.
o	Are there any insights you could find?
•	Answer the following 2 questions:
o	Which segments of customers perform better than others and why?
	In this case performance is defined as the expected income per offer (IPO).
	IPO= Sale *(Main_Income + Addon_Income + Finance_Income) 
o	Build a model to predict how likely a customer is to sell at their current gross price.
	We would expect this model to include some terms derived from the price we offer.
	Please find attached for the data dictionary for descriptions of each variable. 
•	Use Python and Jupyter notebook
•	You can use any Python libraries as you see fit.
•	Write your comments along with the codes
